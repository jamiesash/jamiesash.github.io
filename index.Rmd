## About me 

I'm James Ash but I go by Jamie. I'm a master's student in the chemical oceanography
department at the University of Hawaii. I spend my time working, surfing, 
playing board games, and paddling for an outrigger canoe team.

*Laboratory Assistant* \hfill								                                    01/2017 - 01/2019  
Assist in ongoing air-sea gas exchange experiments including; Influence of surfactants on air-sea gas exchange, and Influence of wind and bottom generated turbulence on air-sea gas exchange in shallow water environments. Participate in related research cruises in the Baltic Sea and Florida Everglades. Participated in multiple one week trips to the Florida Everglades National Park to maintain and upkeep time series equipment. The purpose of the time series measurements are to capture environmental parameters at water flow choke points between the mangrove estuary and the coastal ocean for quantifying inorganic carbon flux in mangrove systems.
